# Nike Sales Data Cleaning Project (Python & Pandas)

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a raw Nike sales dataset using Python and Pandas.  
The aim is to transform unclean sales data into a structured and analysis-ready format.

---

## Project Overview

In real-world business scenarios, sales datasets often contain missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.  
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to clean such data step by step and prepare it for analysis, reporting, or BI dashboards.

The final result is a cleaned CSV file that can be used for further data analysis or visualization.
